## About
Hey, y'all, this Single Page Django Application is a cumulation of the things I've learned in the Backend Portion of my times at [Nashville Software School](https://github.com/nashville-software-school). It is not neccessarily the best representation of my skills, but I am the cause of my own bugs in my code of life.

There is another project that I started, but I made it more complicated than it needed to be, and I am paying the price for it.
